## Open questions

### Seeding randomness

- How do we seed randomness so that NPC movement is deterministic?

### More complex scenarios

- Can we script behavior into scenes? E.g. make the player character move around in a deterministic way?

### Behavior of libraries

- Does ffmpeg always generate a green screen when there is no difference? Do the pixel values ever change?

### Multiplayer

- Can we support it? How do we deal with lag?
